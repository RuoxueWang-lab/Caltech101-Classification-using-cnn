# Image Classification for Caltech101 Dataset using CNN (In Progress)
So far the CNN model has reached a 50% accuracy for this classification task. Trying to fine-tune the hyperparameters or redesigning the layers to reach higher accuracy.

# Current Status
- The CNN model has achieved 50% accuracy so far. We're facing over-fitting problem now.
-  Work is ongoing to improve performance by:
   1. Fine-tuning hyperparameters
   2. Redesigning network layers to enhance accuracy.

# TO-DOs
1. Implement learning rate schedules and regularization methods.
2. Experiment with different architectures (e.g., ResNet, VGG, etc.).
3. Evaluate and compare the performance of pre-trained models.

# Dataset
Caltech101 Dataset: A widely used dataset containing images categorized into 101 object classes and one background class.

# Results:
- Current Accuracy: 50%
- Visualizations and training logs will be added in future updates.
