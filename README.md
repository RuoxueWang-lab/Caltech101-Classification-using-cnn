# Image Classification for Caltech101 Dataset using CNN (In Progress)

## Current Status
- We're facing overfitting. Since the Caltech101 dataset is small, training a CNN on it from scratch is easy to cause overfitting.
-  Work is ongoing to improve performance by:
   1. Data Augmentation.

# TO-DOs
1. Experiment with different architectures (e.g., ResNet, VGG, etc.).
2. Evaluate and compare the performance of pre-trained models.

# Dataset
Caltech101 Dataset: A widely used dataset containing images categorized into 101 object classes and one background class.

# Results:
- Overfitting
- Visualizations and training logs will be added in future updates.
