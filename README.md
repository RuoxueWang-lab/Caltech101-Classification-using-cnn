# Image Classification for Caltech101 Dataset using CNN (In Progress)

## Current Status
-Overfitting has been mitigated by implementing data augmentation.
-However, the model is currently underperforming in terms of training and validation accuracy, indicating potential issues with the model's capacity or learning process.
-Work is ongoing to improve performance by:
 1.Adjusting architectural hyperparameters (e.g., layers, filters).
 2.Experimenting with different optimizers and learning rates.
 3.Exploring transfer learning with pre-trained models.

# TO-DOs
1. Experiment with different architectures (e.g., ResNet, VGG, etc.).
2. Evaluate and compare the performance of pre-trained models.

# Dataset
Caltech101 Dataset: A widely used dataset containing images categorized into 101 object classes and one background class.

# Results:
-Overfitting resolved: Data augmentation successfully mitigated overfitting.
-Current challenge: The model is not learning effectively, as evidenced by high training loss and low accuracy.
-Visualizations and training logs will be added in future updates.
